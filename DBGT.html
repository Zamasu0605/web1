      Dragon Ball GT (Japanese: ドラゴンボールGTジーティー, Hepburn: Doragon Bōru Jī Tī) is a Japanese anime series based on Akira Toriyama's Dragon Ball manga. Produced by Toei Animation, the series premiered in Japan on Fuji TV and ran for 64 episodes from February 1996 to November 1997. Unlike the previous two anime in the Dragon Ball franchise, Dragon Ball GT does not adapt the manga by Toriyama, but is an anime-exclusive sequel show to the Dragon Ball Z anime with an original story using the same characters and universe, which follows the exploits of Goku, his granddaughter Pan, and their various associates. However, Toriyama had designed some of the new characters introduced to the show.
